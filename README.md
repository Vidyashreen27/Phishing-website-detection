# Phishing-website-detection
🛡️ Phishing Website Detection using Machine Learning
📄 Project Description
This project focuses on detecting phishing websites using machine learning techniques by analyzing various URL and website-based features. Phishing is a major cybersecurity threat that deceives users into revealing sensitive information through fake websites. Our solution leverages a trained ML model to differentiate between legitimate and malicious websites based on extracted features from URLs and site metadata.

🧠 Features Considered
The model evaluates multiple indicators, including:

Presence or absence of HTTPS

Length and structure of the URL

Usage of IP addresses instead of domain names

Domain age and DNS record information

Number of subdomains and special characters

External resource linking and redirection behavior

🔧 Technologies Used
Python

Libraries:

Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)

Scikit-learn (model training and evaluation)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (data visualization)

Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook

🧪 Model & Evaluation
We trained and tested multiple classification algorithms including:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine

The best-performing model achieved over 90% accuracy, with strong precision and recall, validated using metrics like the confusion matrix and ROC curve.

📊 Results
The final model demonstrates high reliability in detecting phishing websites, making it suitable for practical security applications.

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository

Install dependencies:
